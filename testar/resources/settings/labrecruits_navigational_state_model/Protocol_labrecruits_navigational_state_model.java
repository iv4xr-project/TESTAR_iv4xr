/**
 * iv4xr EU H2020 project - LabRecruits Demo
 * 
 * In this protocol LabRecruits game will act as SUT.
 * labrecruits_commands_testar_agent_dummy_explorer / test.setting file contains the:
 * - COMMAND_LINE definition to start the SUT and load the desired level
 * - State model inference settings to connect and create the State Model inside OrientDB
 * 
 * TESTAR is the Agent itself, derives is own knowledge about the observed entities,
 * and takes decisions about the command actions to execute (observe, moveTo, interactWith)
 * 
 * TESTAR uses the Navigation map internally to select a visible node and explore this LabRecruits level.
 * This level (test.settings -> buttons_doors_1) has block elements,
 * We need to explore different paths to surround the elements that block us.
 * 
 * Widget              -> Virtual Entity
 * State (Widget-Tree) -> Agent Observation (All Observed Entities)
 * Action              -> LabRecruits low level command
